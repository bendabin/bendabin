### Hello from planet Earth! 🌎 I'm Ben. 

### Biography ###

My passion and interest for science and technology started at the age of 5. I was always interested in knowing how things worked. I would often disassemble my favourite toys because I was interested in knowing what the internal components were and how they worked. The toys ranged from trainsets to small things such as calculators and a tamagotchi(a popular virtual egg pet you that every 90's child had). My passion and interest for technology eventually resulted in graduating from University in 2014 with a degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering, where I had majored in Embedded Software Engineering.

I have been living in Japan since March 2020 and currently working as an ALT at an Elementary School. I also work freelance as a Software Developer and in my freetime I study new programming techniques and algorithms. My main areas of interest are full stack web development. Please have a look through my portfolio to see what I have been working on. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions I'll look forward to hearing from you and it would be nice to get the chance to work on some interesting projects together.
