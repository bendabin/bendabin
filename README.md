### Hello from planet Earth! ðŸŒŽ I'm Ben. 

My passion and interest for science and technology started at the age of 5. I was always interested in knowing how things worked. I would often disassemble my favourite toys because I was interested in knowing what the internal components were and how they worked. The toys ranged from trainsets to small things such as calculators and tamagotchi(a popular virtual egg pet you that every 90's child had). 

My first actual programming experience started when I left school at the age of 16, where I had completed a 2 year diploma in Electronics and Electrical Engineering and learned how to code in Turbo Pascal and assembly language for microcontrollers. 

My passion and interested for technology eventually resulted in me graduating from University in Electrnics and Electrical Engineering where I had specialised in Embedded Software Engineering.
