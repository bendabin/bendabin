### Hello from planet Earth! ðŸŒŽ I'm Ben. 

### Biography ###

My passion and interest for science and technology started at the age of 5. I was always interested in knowing how things worked. I would often disassemble my favourite toys because I was interested in knowing what the internal components were and how they worked. The toys ranged from trainsets to small things such as calculators and a tamagotchi(a popular virtual egg pet you that every 90's child had). 

My first actual programming experience started when I left school at the age of 16, where I had completed a 2 year diploma course in Electronics and Electrical Engineering and learned how to code in Turbo Pascal and assembly language for microcontrollers. 

I first learned how to program in C++, after doing a one week work experience with a small technology company at the age of 17. 

My passion and interested for technology eventually resulted in me graduating from University in 2014 with a degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering, where I had majored in Embedded Software Engineering. 

After graduating fron university I worked for a number of companies, with the first company being a company that specialises in the manufacturing of industrial equipment used in the food processing industry. 

From 2017 to 2019, I trained and worked as a trainee electrician after becoming interested in electricial power wiring in homes and commercial buildings.
